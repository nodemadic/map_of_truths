### Foundational Truths
This document discusses the selection of a foundational truth or principle that serves as the basis for the entire belief system in the hierarchy found in this repository.

## Determinism vs. Subjective Awareness
Initially, I considered adopting hard determinism as the top-level statement in the hierarchy. This position holds that every event in the universe, including human actions and decisions, is determined by previous events and the laws of nature.

However, I sought a more fundamental starting point that would better serve as a foundation for my beliefs.

## Adopting a Cartesian Approach
Inspired by Descartes, I chose to begin with a statement that affirms the existence of a thinking subject:

> "I am aware of my own thoughts and experiences."

This foundational truth acknowledges the presence of a self-aware, conscious individual capable of having subjective experiences and reflecting upon them.

## Summary
By establishing subjective awareness as the foundational truth, we create a robust starting point for building the belief hierarchy in this repository. This approach ensures that the belief system is rooted in the fundamental existence of a thinking subject, allowing for a more cohesive and grounded set of beliefs.
