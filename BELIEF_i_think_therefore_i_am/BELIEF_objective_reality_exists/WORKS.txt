Martin Heidegger:
- An Introduction to Metaphysics (1953) [book]
Argues for the existence of a "world" that is independent of human perception and experience, and that provides the foundation for all human activity and understanding.

Thomas Kuhn:
- The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962) [book]

ARGUMENTS AGAINST OBJECTIVE REALITY

Bruce Rosenblum and Fred Kuttner
- The Quantum Enigma (2006) [book]
Explores the philosophical implications of quantum mechanics, arguing that the fundamental uncertainty and indeterminacy of the quantum world suggests a deep ambiguity and subjectivity in our understanding of reality.

John McDowell
- Mind and World (1994) [book]
Challenges the idea that our perceptions can provide direct access to an objective reality, arguing that our understanding of the world is always shaped by our concepts and theories.
