To start building a tree of logic and truths, you must first find a core irrefutable truth to build from. My line of reason closely resembles the first two meditations of Ren√© Descartes, which I will provide as an additional resource and summarize here.

All Descartes had previously thought he knew came to him through the senses. Through a process of methodological doubt in the first meditation, he withdraws completely from the senses. At any moment he could be dreaming, or his senses could be deceived either by God or by some evil demon, so he concludes that he cannot trust his senses about anything.

In the second meditation, however, he realizes that he cannot doubt his own existence. In order to doubt or to think, there must be someone doing the doubting or thinking. Deceived as he may be about other things, he cannot help but conclude that he exists. Since his existence follows from the fact that he is thinking, he concludes that he knows at least that he is a thing that thinks. He further reasons that he comes to know this fact by means of his intellect, and that the mind is far better known to him than the body.

I find this to be an excellent starting point to build all knowledge from. Even if my senses cannot be trusted completely and the world as I know it could be an illusion, I can at least acknowledge that I exist. Even if the thoughts that I think bear no agency, I can still acknowledge that I am thinking.

Cogito, ergo sum. I think, therefore I am.
