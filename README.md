A few of the key concepts at the core of Web3 are transparency, immutability, and accountability. These concepts have great value beyond their emerging use found in transactions and decentralized applications.

This repository is intended to show the logic that builds up my beliefs about everything. It is to be added to and edited, but the old beliefs will still be able to be seen in their original commits.

Any belief written in the contents of this repo that you believe to be wrong can be challenged. Any statement made that you find to be a contradiction of a higher layerâ€™s statement can and should be argued with. This can be done by forking and making a pull request or by sending a message via twitter or email. I will strive to transparently argue or approve the edits as they are received.

GitHub is a tool that works well for storing these thoughts, but it cannot provide an easily understandable visual to reference. My intention is to make a tool to provide a better interface of viewing this tree of beliefs and allowing easier interaction from others.
